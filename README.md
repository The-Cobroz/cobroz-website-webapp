 Cobroz is an online discussion platform developed for the Indian legal sector. This platform aims to bridge the gap between the common people of India and best legal advice in the country. Cobroz acts as an aggregator to help people navigate through the complexites of legal landscape.

Some of the prominent features of the application:
* Add, edit and delete post
* Add Comments to the post
* Connect (or as I like to say "bro") each other
* User authentication and authorization
* Customize profiles

This project uses following tech stack:
* React.js (Frontend Functionality)
* Node.js & Express.js (Server side functionality)
* MySQL (Database)
* Bootstrap CSS (Responsive UI)
